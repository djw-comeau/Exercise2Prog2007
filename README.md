Instructions for Module 2 Exercise

You are tasked with completing a specific program using the topics covered in Module 2. Follow these exact requirements to ensure your submission is complete.

1. Program Requirements

You must write a program in C that performs the following:

        Use Floating-Point Numbers:
        Declare a float variable for the radius of a circle.
        Declare a double variable for the constant Pi.

).
Use these variables to calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula:

Demonstrate Type Conversion:

    Explicitly convert the floating-point circumference to an integer and store it in a new variable.
    Print both the original floating-point value and the integer-converted value.

Use Scientific Notation:

    Declare a double variable for Planck’s constant (6.626x10-34) and print its value in scientific notation using %e.

    Output Formatting:
            Use printf to format and display the results:
            The radius of the circle with 2 decimal places.
            The floating-point circumference with 3 decimal places.
            The integer-converted circumference as an integer.
            Planck’s constant in scientific notation.

    Comments:
        Add comments to explain the purpose of the program and the functionality of each section of code.

Video Demonstration

    Record Your Screen:
            Open your IDE or terminal with the completed program.
            Run the program and explain the output step-by-step:
            Show the value of the radius.
            Show the calculated circumference (both floating-point and integer values).
            Display Planck’s constant in scientific notation.

    Save the Video:

        Upload the Video:
        Upload the video to a file-sharing platform (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, or YouTube as unlisted).
        Copy the shareable link.

Final Submission

        Ensure the following are complete:
        Your code is pushed to the repository.
        Your video is uploaded, and the link is accessible.
        Submit both the repository link and the video in Brightspace submission box.
